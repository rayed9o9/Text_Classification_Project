take it make sure you pay attention to the lesson okay anybody want to take this come on you learn by trying nobody oliver what do you make of these three numbers the answer is eight the answer is eight not quite i see what you did there though you were adding instead of multiplying very good try oliver anyone else want to give it a go go ahead byron how come oliver still gets to use his phone in class but you took mine away he s autistic dude so he gets special treatment oliver gets to use his phone because he wasn t playing i fortnite i during the pledge of allegiance ooh let s get back

to are very you are very ugly who s ugly now come on i i didn t know what to think when i pulled up i and he wasn t there waiting for me i went right into the worst case scenarios uh did he get in trouble did someone take him and then i found him just screaming in the field that sounds very scary for both of you and he lost his phone somehow i wish he could explain what happened good now we re gonna try using our words lost in field we re gonna work on your f s okay f s can be tricky field field can you try that f f f oliver you can do it f okay good practicing i have you been trying to provide him i i with social experiences i like we discussed poor guy still doesn t have any friends you said he was hanging out with your friend s son jennifer s son byron yeah yeah w we re not close

to swoop in and be the hero once again the hero it s not all presents and tummy tickles with me like it is with you i just wish i could take that part of him and put it in a box and tape it up and hide it somewhere so he didn t have to deal with it then he wouldn t be our oliver i should ve i should ve taken him sooner what if he never learns to talk because i didn t do anything for so long no we didn t do anything he s never looked me in the eyes do you know what it s like for your own child to never look you in the eyes well he s got nice eyes if that helps no marty it doesn t help

got to get to dad we can t stay here honey i m sure it s nothing but better to be safe right can you look at me we should get going okay and no screens oliver what are you talking about i know it sounds crazy but i was reading this story about larry and then the lights they started going on and off and then another one was going on and off it was like he was using the electricity to move around the room and then he screwed in all the new light bulbs so he helped you with your chores he must have needed the power or something to come alive larry larry i knew i shouldn t have moved out i m not making this up oliver saw him there is something inside our house o oliver here tell daddy he wants me as friend this thing wants our son okay i think you need a good night s sleep i ll take him to school in the morning no i am not letting him out of our sight how do we know the school is safe okay well why don t i bring him to work with me tonight if he s not going to school tomorrow absolutely not oh come on what you don t trust me with him no it s not that it s rest is important for the body so you sleep and we can talk about all this tomorrow really come on let me take care of him give this and the change to the gentleman there you go thanks so much have a good one my man is a pro very nicely done see look how good you are at that you could take over for me some nights the best part is that in between cars you can do whatever you want you can listen to the radio you can even watch i spongebob i oh hey ah is this the infamous haunted screen it s okay hey do you know how your nightmares aren t real well neither are ghosts or ghouls or vampires or witches and certainly not larrys this is larry will you be larry s friend it s nothing happens all the time it s okay huh hang tight all right let s see what we have here oliver what are you doing buddy what if a car drove in huh you got to be more careful hey here give me this look hey hey hey hey hey hey look buddy there s nothing hey look at me okay there s nothing out there okay i ll show you look see look at that see totally safe oliver let him go okay okay okay i saw through that that that screen the way he was holding oliver why does he want our son the story said something um about uh a true friend is what you lack he hasn t had a friend since since oh yeah since jennifer and i got in our fight i know yeah some stupid fight hey oliver hit byron and then she decided our son was dangerous either way he s been lonely long before that i mean oliver s been staring at his screens for years and that that thing has been staring right back and how come we can t see it huh i i don t know doesn t make any sense how how can he be here and not here at the same time what have you got honey that s very nice we got some kid larry s in his world and we re in ours but but we re also together larry can interact with us but he can t reach us he can t get to oliver yet that s why he wants to get into our world if that s his window then we have to destroy it before it becomes his door we have the cookie we have the blue car and you get to choose whichever one you want what s it gonna be yeah good marty and i both experienced it it s not just in oliver s imagination i ll be right back kiddo sarah do you know what a physical empath is no it s when you love someone so much that you feel or experience their pain it s a good sign it shows just how much you care about oliver and it s very common in parents so you re saying that we could be seeing his imagination because we love him that doesn t make any sense but an invisible monster that travels through electricity does well we re hoping that that s over now because we destroyed that thing so does he have a way to communicate i ll let him take my phone with him to school until we can afford a new one unless you could get him talking first sarah come on it s it s extremely rare for kids his age to start verbalizing in the way i fear you re imagining i know i know i just i just want to make sure that you still have the right expectations if he can say a few words maybe a sentence here or there that would be a big win we have to keep remembering his strengths have you seen him again what s this he gave it to me seriously yes then mom and dad broke him broke him s so like he s gone then yes can i ask you something yes why d you stop being my friend we used to hang out all the time i did bad thing you did punch face your mom mad i barely even had a bruise the next day i was asking my mom when we could have another sleepover but she played me a message from your mom your mom said you didn t want to be my friend anymore that is lie wait so you never said that lie wrong i never lie moms are so weird what are you watching over there wait let me guess i spongebob i no no help hello somebody help where are you no shit you need any help with your homework hey i talked to jennifer today she said byron s doing much better hello how we found him in his car on the side of the road we re not sure how it happened he was unresponsive w we rushed him to the hospital hello hello hello welcome to the krusty krab how may i help you yeah did you turn it on two large fries and a jumbo krabby patty hey what s that what are you doing behind the counter he will follow you until you finish the story why are you doing this to us where did you come from world only look at screens not each other what what does that mean people very lonely all that loneliness in world made larry larry made of loneliness larry is lonely how do you think i would feel if larry took oliver finish the story finish the story no no no no no no stop stop no no no can you just be normal for one second oliver oliver i didn t mean it honey sometimes even moms and dads say things that they shouldn t i just i your dad he s been in an accident and um they re trying to wake him up something happened to him and i think it was larry and i cannot let
